image_view:
	ros2 launch image_view image_view.launch.py image:=<image topic>
	Subscribed Topics
	image (sensor_msgs/Image)
    	The image topic. Should be remapped to the name of the real image topic.
	Parameters
	~autosize (bool, default: false)
		Whether the window should autosize itself to the image or be resizeable by the user. 
	~filename_format (string, default: "frame%04i.jpg")
		printf-style format for saved image names. Use to control name, location and format of saved images. 
	~image_transport (string, default: "raw")
		Transport used for the image stream. image_view allows you to specify this as a simple command-line argument for convenience. 
	~window_name (string, default: name of the image topic)
		The name of the display window.
disparity_view:
	ros2 launch image_view disparity_view.launch.py image:=<disparity image topic>
	Subscribed Topics
	image (stereo_msgs/DisparityImage)
		The disparity image topic. Should be remapped to the name of the real topic. 
	Parameters
	~autosize (bool, default: false)
		Whether the window should autosize itself to the image or be resizeable by the user. 
	~window_name (string, default: name of the image topic)
		The name of the display window.
stereo_view:	
	ros2 launch image_view stereo_view stereo:=<stereo namespace> image:=<image topic identifier>
	Subscribed Topics
	<stereo>/left/<image> (sensor_msgs/Image)
		The left image topic. Formal parameters stereo and image should be remapped appropriately. 
	<stereo>/right/<image> (sensor_msgs/Image)
		The right image topic. Formal parameters stereo and image should be remapped appropriately. 
	<stereo>/disparity (stereo_msgs/DisparityImage)
		The disparity image computed from the left/right stereo pair. 
	Parameters
	~autosize (bool, default: true)
		Whether the windows should autosize to the image or be resizeable by the user. 
	~filename_format (string, default: "%s%04i.jpg")
    	printf-style format for saved image names. Use to control name, location and format of saved images. The string argument is "left" or "right". 
	~image_transport (string, default: "raw")
    	Transport used for the image streams. 
	~approximate_sync (bool, default: false)
    	Whether to use approximate synchronization. Set to true if the left and right cameras do not produce exactly synced timestamps. 
	~queue_size (int, default: 5)
    	Size of message queue for each synchronized topic. You may need to raise this if disparity processing takes too long, or if there are significant network delays.
